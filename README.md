## Describe your project in detail below

This program will create an HTML page from a template that takes in user input. 

The program uses the sys, os, and datetime modules. 

When the program writes the final html file, it will save the files in the assets page.

For images, save them within the same 'pics' directory for ease of use. You can always create a seperate directory, as long as you change the src attribute's path in the code (line 25) to match the new directory.
